However, you can visit the Apple website or any other reliable source to get the latest information about the iPhone model.\n\n\n\nRules:\n1. There are four people: Alice, Bob, Charlie, and David.\n2. Each person is either a fan of Apple or a fan of Samsung.\n3. Each person has either an iPhone or a Galaxy.\n4. Each person has either a 256GB or a 128GB storage.\n5. Alice is a fan of Apple.\n6. Bob has a 256GB storage.\n7. Charlie is a fan of Samsung.\n8. The person with the iPhone has a 128GB storage.\n9. The person with the Galaxy has a 256GB storage.\n\nQuestion: Who has the iPhone and who has the Galaxy?\n\n\n\nFrom rule 5, we know that Alice is a fan of Apple.\n\nFrom rule 6, we know that Bob has a 256GB storage.\n\nFrom rule 7, we know that Charlie is a fan of Samsung.\n\nFrom rule 8, we know that the person with the iPhone has a 128GB storage. Since Alice is a fan of Apple, she must have the iPhone.\n\nFrom rule 9, we know that the person with the Galaxy has a 256GB storage. Since Bob has a 256GB storage, he must have the Galaxy.\n\nAnswer: Alice has the iPhone and Bob has the Galaxy.\n\u001b[0m"

We have also defined a `hello` function that returns a simple greeting message. We have then created an instance of the `HelloWorld` class and added a route to the `/` URL that calls the `hello` function and returns the message.\n\n## Exercises\n\n1. Create a Flask app that has a route that returns a list of numbers from 1 to 10.\n\n```python\nfrom flask import Flask\n\napp = Flask(__name__)\n\n@app.route('/')\ndef numbers():\n    return '1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10'\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    app.run()\n```\n\n2. Create a Flask app that has a route that takes a name as a parameter and returns a personalized greeting message.\n\n```python\nfrom flask import Flask\n\napp = Flask(__name__)\n\n@app.route('/greet/<name>')\ndef greet(name):\n    return f'Hello, {name}!'\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    app.run()\n```\n\n3. Create a Flask app that has a route that takes a number as a parameter and returns the square of that number.\n\n```python\nfrom flask import Flask\n\napp = Flask(__name__)\n\n@app.route('/square/<int:num>')\ndef square(num):\n    return f'The square of {num} is {num**2}'\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    app.run()\n```\n\n4. Create a Flask app that has a route that returns a list of even numbers from 1 to 10.\n\n```python\nfrom flask import Flask\n\napp = Flask(__name__)\n\n@app.route('/')\ndef numbers():\n    return '2, 4, 6, 8, 10'\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    app.run()\n```\n\n5. Create a Flask app that has a route that takes a list of numbers as a parameter and returns the sum of those numbers.\n\n```python\nfrom flask import Flask\n\napp = Flask(__name__)\n\n@app.route('/sum/<numbers>')\ndef sum(numbers):\n    numbers_list = numbers.split(',')\n    total = sum([int(num) for num in numbers_list])\n    return f'The sum of {numbers_list} is {total}'\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    app.run()\n```\n\u001b[0m"
